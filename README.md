# react-mini-coding-checkpoints

Conceptually a series of incrementally challenging mini-labs designed to reinforce and explore concepts for developers new to React.

Current lab ideas (each li is a separate lab):

- Render data from state into component directly into 1 card. Then, fetch to external api to set state from that fetch, triggering a re-render.
- Render data from external api into collection of cards, through a collection component (props). Bonus: some way to incorporate a functional component
- Render data conditionally. One (or more) show/hide or other boolean conditional renders.
- Full CRUD through React to external API with React. Controlled form (form inputs set state for a post)
- Filter/sort/search lab in sibling components -> Data bubbling and state trickle (like magic number in proptipus)
- Mocked log-in lab (collection of users with passwords, need to connect user-create form and user-login form. States exist as loose guidance for currentUser, allUsers, loggedIn, etc)


Should each be made into unique folders in this repository, in numbered difficulty (maybe?).

Work on branches, ask before merging into main, and have fun!
