- Full CRUD through React to external API with React. Controlled form (form inputs set state for a post)
It's nice to be able to manipulate data that exists, but what if we wanted to fully interact with our database? This lab will require us to connect our React front end to an external API for full CRUD functionality...Not only will we do our `GET` for our initial data, but we will connect event listeners and forms to complete a `PATCH`, `POST`, and `DELETE` as well!
