# NAME OF LAB GOES HERE

## Outline of lab in progress, brainstorming, etc go

Maybe some kind of random api (or can we set up a db.json api randomizer?) to connect to a button fetch? Gif collection, jokes, something like that?

## Clear, Concise, Coding Checkpoint Concept Clarification (The six C's?)

After finishing this practice we should have an (arguably) practical application of using state to render data dynamically into a React component, as well as connecting an event listener to a button to fetch new information that updates state. With the magic of React, this will trigger a re-render and display our newly fetched data instantly without page refresh.

## Instructions to install/run go here

## Rough draft of actual readme below here

# Notes
By loading the src using a query string for the logo image:
```
<img className="logo" src={`${this.state.logo}?${Time.now()}`} alt="Restaurant"></img>
```
we force a re-render of the image. If not, the image would stay the same due to it being cached.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
